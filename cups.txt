Got working unders CUPS with:
  Description:	Xerox WorkCentre 7845
  Location:	Denali Towers
  Driver:	Xerox Phaser 7760GX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.10 (grayscale, 2-sided printing)
  Connection:	dnssd://Xerox%20WorkCentre%207845%20(9C%3A93%3A4E%3A55%3A51%3A09)._ipp._tcp.local/
  Defaults:	job-sheets=none, none media=na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided
